    "p1": "Lauren O’Neal Jones's parents probably didn’t realize just how many soccer games they would be attending when they signed her up for her first soccer team at the age of five. Attending Area 2 schools, Lauren went to Hammond Hill, Paul Knox, and finally North Augusta High.  She started playing soccer for the High School when she was in 7th grade.  Throughout her high school career, Lauren was All Region and is known for playing more games during her high school years than any other player; that record still holds today.  Lauren was the Augusta Chronicle Player of the year in 1998 and helped her club soccer team win two state championships. In fact, Lauren was so skilled at the game, she was on the Olympic Development Team from 1993 - 1998.",
    "p2": "Continuing to play in college, she was awarded a division 1 soccer scholarship to Charleston Southern.  She was awarded the Big South Player of the Week in 1999 and the Coaches Award in 2002.  Her coaches thought enough of her to make her the team captain during her Senior year.",
    "p3": "Lauren was also a versatile player.  During one game in high school, she played every single position.  While scoring 8 goals in one half here at NAHS is certainly something to remember, her most memorable moment was scoring 2 goals during her freshman year to beat College of Charleston 2-0 to win the Silver Cup.  She’s very proud to have never lost to College of Charleston in her career.",
    "p4": "Today, Lauren is a sales executive for a pharmaceutical company.  Volunteering with Meals on Wheels in Greenville After spending 13 years in Boston, Lauren is raising her three-year-old daughter, Larkin, in Greenville, SC.  She is happy to be back in the South near her family and friends.  She was very excited to hear she is being inducted to the North Augusta Sports Hall of Fame, not only to have a soccer player recognized but also to be inducted the same year as her good friend Darby Sligh."
