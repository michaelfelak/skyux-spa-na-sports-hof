    "p1": "Pat Carpenter can best be described as the most valuable volunteer to ever live in North Augusta. The former Pat Cooper and a life-long North Augusta resident, she participated in middle school basketball under then head coach Sandy Wylie. Pat credits her as the inspiration to help others. 'Miss Pat', as she is known by all of North Augusta, is married to husband Ken and has two children, daughter Fran Carpenter Risse and son Frank Carpenter. She is also the proud grandparent of Ella Risse and Luke Carpenter.",
    "p2": "Her first coaching position was as a 19 year old leading a 14 year old girls softball team and has been involved ever since. It is the rule, rather than the exception for Pat to coach three teams at one time, although she admits to reducing that to two in the last few seasons. She has coached boys and girls in baseball, softball, basketball and cheerleading at many different levels. Included in this service are the cheerleading squads at North Augusta Middle School and the B team at North Augusta High School for many years.",
    "p3": "It is safe to say Pat has had a direct influence on more people than any other person in North Augusta history by her tireless dedication and commitment of time to the youth of our community. She has coached generations of children, the number certainly in the thousands and continuing to grow. According to Rick Meyer of the Parks, Recreation &amp; Leisure Services Department, \"Pat Carpenter is our most energetic and passionate volunteer. She coaches girls, boys, handicapped, young and older children with all the same love. Kids and parents know how much she cares and all want to be on her team. She loves Riverview Park like it's the other side of heaven.\"",
    "p4": "Pat is serving her fourth term on City Council, now in her fourteenth year. Among other many volunteer efforts, she has taught Sunday School at First Baptist Church for the last 38 years, mostly at the middle school level."
