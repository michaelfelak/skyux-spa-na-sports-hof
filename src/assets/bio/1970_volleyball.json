Coach Diane Shuler immediately polled the girls and got a strong and enthusiasticresponse. Girls were eager and excited to have another sport available. Permission was granted to field a team. Tryouts were held and a team was established. North Augusta would lead the way in Aiken County as the only school to initiate a team. The girls eagerly practiced for 6 weeks even though they had no regular schedule and no idea how they would fare with other teams in the state, but their resolve and determination were evident.",

After impressively winning eight consecutive matches, they were crowned Region Champions. They had several close games with two tie-breakers, but soundly defeated most of their opponents.
