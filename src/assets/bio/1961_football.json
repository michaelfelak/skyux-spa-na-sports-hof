    "p1": "The 1961 football team at North Augusta High School could be called “The Team That Would Not Die, “The Team That Would Not Quit”. After a talented 1960 team failed to make the playoffs, team members began their own workouts during the summer months at Lions Field. In a time when off season or year round training was rarely done, these players had one goal, a State Championship season. The season was magical for several reasons. Despite a 21-9 loss to Richmond Academy in Game 2, the Yellow Jackets reeled off ten straight wins, including a playoff win over Beaufort 34-13, to earn a Sand Hills Conference Championship and a spot in the title game. A rematch against Clinton at Lion’s Field on a cold, damp Thanksgiving night was all that remained between North Augusta and the school’s second state football championship. The Jackets would enter the game without the services of starting quarterback, Bobby Stillwell, who had broken his arm during week 4, and led by team captains Mike Smith and Steve Griffin. Entering the championship game, the backfield of Sandy Smith, 687 yards rushing, Gene Williams, 719 yards rushing, and Craig Baynham, 995 yards rushing, were at full strength.",
    "p2": "The Jackets defeated Clinton 19-0 thanks to William’s two touchdowns and Baynham’s one. A stingy “Monster” defense designed by Head Coach Cally Gault, Assistants Jim Buist, Ray Burris and Webster Grayson kept Clinton out of the end zone for the second time this season. With the victory, North Augusta finished the year with a 12-1 record, setting the school record for the most wins in one season. Baynham finished the year with 1079 yards, the first North Augusta running back to rush for over 1000 yards.",
    "p3": "Cally Gault would be named Coach of the Year for the State of South Carolina and Craig Baynham, Gene Williams, and offensive guard Sonny Anderson would earn All State honors."
