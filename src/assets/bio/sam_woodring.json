    "p1": "Sam Woodring settled in North Augusta in April,1951 and purchased the STAR in 1954. He began to cover the North Augusta High School football games and developed a friendship with Coach Cally Gault. The Yellow Jackets seldom received mention in Augusta papers and suddenly they were front page news makers in The STAR. Woodring broached the idea of Player of the Week and Outstanding Player of the Year. He didn’t let anyone else write football coverage as long as he was physically able to do the job.",
    "p2": "Woodring sponsored a City Championship between Paul Knox and North Augusta Middle School with trophies and programs. He helped the Optimists who began a football program similar to the baseball program which was up and running. Some years later the Optimists organized a basketball program which again was touted strongly by the STAR.",
    "p3": "Perhaps his most exciting project was his massive blitz of publicity when without a tax dollar, North Augusta raised $200,000 for a stadium beside the new high school. While Woodring was recognized as Citizen of the Year, won Service to Mankind recognition, Governor’s Order of the Palmetto and other honors throughout his career, his work publicizing North Augusta football remained one of his fondest accomplishments."
