    "p1": "A lifelong resident of North Augusta, he is the third oldest child of what is often recognized as the most athletic family in our history. E. Earl Baynham graduated from North Augusta High School in 1949, the first class that was required to go twelve years instead of eleven and played football from 1944 to 1948.",
    "p2": "He played for Coach Weir Gilmore and Ed Stillwell as a tailback on a very talented and successful football squad. As a tailback and linebacker, he was instrumental in their stellar record that recorded five shutouts in 1945, four more in 1946 and six more in 1947, losing only to eventual state champions in Georgia and South Carolina.",
    "p3": "The 1947 and 1948 teams both won Section 3 championships and entered the State playoffs. Both teams lost to a powerful Liberty team. Earl Baynham was the 1947 CSRA scoring champion with 125 points that included 30 extra points. He was offered a football scholarship to attend The Citadel upon graduation from North Augusta and was selected to play in the 1948 Shrine Bowl in Charlotte, NC.",
    "p4": "Also a baseball standout, he participated on the team that won the 1949 State Championship by defeating Cheraw and was a teammate of fellow inductee Donald Metz. During that championship run, Earl batted second and played left field, reaching base 10 straight times against first round opponent Jonesville that included nine hits. Earl Baynham will be remembered as a fierce competitor and the “go to man” on any team he participated. He is married to the former Ann Hall and has three children, Janet Baynham, Wayne and Cindy Baynham Sanders."
